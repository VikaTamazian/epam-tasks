Code Exercise
Create the package by.gsu.epamlab and define the class Material inside which represents uniform material.
Class fields:
name,
density.
Constructors:
no-arg constructor;
parameterized constructor.
Methods:
getters;
toString( ) – returns a string representation of uniform material in the csv–format: each field, separated by the ";" symbol.
Example:
steel;7850.0
Define the class Subject in the same package which represents a subject consisting of a uniform material.
Class fields:
name,
material,
volume.
Constructors:
no-arg constructor;
parameterized constructor.
Methods:
getters/setters;
getMass( ) – returns the subject mass (= density * volume);
toString( ) – returns a string representation of a subject in the csv–format: each field and the mass, separated by the ";" symbol.
Example:
wire;steel;7850.0;0.03;235.5
Define the Runner class in the default package, where:
1. Create the object which represents a steel wire having the volume 0.03 cubic meters.
2. Output the object content to the console, using toString( ) method.
3. Update the wire material to the copper (density = 8500.0) and output its mass.
Example:
The wire mass is 255.0 kg.
